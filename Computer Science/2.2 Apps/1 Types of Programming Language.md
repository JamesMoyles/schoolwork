# 1.2.2.1 Types of Programming Language
## Introduction
There are many different programming languages available
A common way of grouping them is based on how they approach problems
These approaches are known as "paradigms" and are specialised
They focus on being better at different aspects of programming
Many programming languages can share paradigms
The main types are:
- Low level
- Object-oriented
- Declarative
- Procedural
- Functional

Programming paradigms are programming methods that are available to you
## Generations of Programming Languages
### First Generation
Used patterns of binary numbers known as machine code
It was easy to make mistakes and was hard to write
This was then improved to use hex codes such as `7f`
The programming languages did not need translation and they ran very fast
### Second Generation
Solved some of the problems of the first generation
They were called assembly languages or low-level languages
They contained shortened english instructions called mnemonics such as `add` and `sub`
The program that translation the mnemonics was called an assembler
> Still used frequently for real-time applications / drivers and manipulating hardware

### Third Generation
High-level languages that are more user-friendly than the previous generations
They were focused more on specific applications
The user was required to specify all the steps needed to soilve a problem and the keywords were closely related to english
These programming languages could be written in an IDE for fast debugging and translation
### Fourth Generation
As computers became more powerful, software that reduced the time it took to produce programs for the users emerged
For example, a Report Program Generator (RPG) takes the actual data and instructions on how to format a report and produces the report
They are used for analysis in case tools
### Fifth Generation
Experst systems are considered fifth generation programs 
Prolog is considered a fifth generation programming language
You write the application by telling the computer a set of facts and then telling the computer how they relate to each other.
You can then query the program by asking questions
It will search for facts based on the rules you declared and the search you are doing
They do not solve problems like procedural languages
To make an expert system you need:
- An interface to let you enter facts and rules
- A method of storing facts and rules
- An interface to allow you to update facts and rules periodically
- An interface to allow you to ask questions
- An 'inference engine' whicih is software that can actually perform the queries
## Other Ways to Classify Languages
- Low-level
- High-level
- Procedural
- Object-oriented
