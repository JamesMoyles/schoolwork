# 1.2.2.1 Types of Programming Language
## Categories of Software
Software is split into systems software and applications software
### Systems Software
Needed by the system to control the hardware and run applications
#### Operating System
- Provides a user interface
- Memory management
- Interrupt handling
- Processor scheduling
#### Utility Programs
Utility programs optimise the performance of the computer and run in the background
- Disk defragmenter
- Automatic backup
- Automatic updating
- Virus checker
- Compression software
##### Disk Defragmenter
Large files stored on a magnetic hard drive may be split up across many physical disk locations and bringing the locations together
Files can be read more quickly
##### Automatic Backup
Data in storage should be regularly backed up
Users may forget to do this
The process may be automated by utility programs that automatically run backups when it makes sense to do them
##### Automatic Updating
Runs in the background and detects software update releases and automatically installs them
This is important for software like anti-viruses that need to get updated frequently
The operating system also completes updates on itself
##### Virus Chcker
Scans permanent storage for viruses by comparing files to known virus definitions
May also scan files as they are opened
Must be kept up to date to be effective
##### Compression Software
Reduces the size of the files to allow for easier distribution of files
#### Libraries and Translators
Allow programs to use pre-written routines and be translated into executable code
### Applications Software
Software that performs a task to benefit the user
They are split into:
- General Purpose
- Special Purpose
- Bespoke
`Off the shelf software` is ready made software to anyone who purchases it
Software that is custom createde for a specific user is known as `bespoke software`
Bespoke software is mostly used by businesses rather than individuals
## Open Source Software
Open source software allows anyone to look at the source code
The software is open source licensed but free to use
Anyone may modify the software and sell it, on the condition that the software produced is also open source
Freeware is software that is free for anyone to use but you cannot look at the source code
## Closed Source Software
Does not allow access to source code
Users must pay the developers
## Selecting an Application
- Functionality
- Hardware
- Availability
- Reliability
