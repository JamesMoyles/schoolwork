# 1.2.1.6 Device Drivers
A driver is a piece of software that converts commands into instructions that hardware can understand
The OS is usually pre-loaded with many drivers for all hardware
As time goes by these will become outdated and the correct driver will need to be downloaded from the web
Any hardware that communicates with the CPU needs a driver
- Printers
- Scanners
- Digital Cameras
- Mp3 Players

Each operating system needs its own driver for the same hardware
Drivers that come pre-installed in the OS are called __generic drivers__ because they are designed to work with most pieces of equipment
Some newer devices may not have generic drivers for them and the actual driver needs to be downloaded
The OS will detect when you plug a peripheral into the PC
It will check for a driver for it, if there is no driver or it is outdated it may ask you to search the web for one
The peripheral should then work
