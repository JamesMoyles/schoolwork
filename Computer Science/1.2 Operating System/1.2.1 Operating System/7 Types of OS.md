# 1.2.1.7 Types of Operating System
## Distributed
A distributed OS can coordinate the processing of a single job across multiple computers
A program can be run by the user that uses data or resources from any other computer
> Resources could include processor time, memory and I/O facilities

This distribution is coordinated by the OS and it passes instructions between computers
The user can access more computational power with the illusion of working with a single processor
- There is no need for training or for programs to be written differently
- A programmer has no control over how the tasks are distributed among the computers as it is handled by the OS

## Multi-tasking
A single processor can give the illusion of carrying out tasks simultaneously through the use of scheduling

## Multi-user
Some systems use a very powerful central computer called a mainframe and have lots of users with the ability to access to powerful CPU of the mainframe through a network and obtain processing time for it
Each terminal also runs many processes
An example is a self-checkout

## Mobile
A smart phone is a computer with a multi-tasking operating system
They are linked to specific hardware
Low level OS is used for handling the hardware and special features such as a cellular connection
The main OS handles the UI and running processes

## Open Source
Open source operating systems allow for more customisation
A device manufacturer can fin-tune the OS to suit their devices and add additional features to enhance UX
Interface and available apps is a major selling point

## Embedded
Many household devices have an OS and run simple programs
Minimal features
- Application programs are held in ROM
- There is a very limited amount of RAM
- The UI is simple and minimal

## Real Time
Some operating systems need to operate in real time, responding quickly to many inputs and doing it simultaneously
This is done using priority interrupts
Seen in safety-critical environments
If hardware fails, the OS must have a backup plan to detect and respond
There is redundancy, if a component fails, the backup will work instead
Used in factory production lines
