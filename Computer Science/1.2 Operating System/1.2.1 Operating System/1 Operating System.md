### Purpose of the Operating System
To control how the computer operates

__Operating system examples include:__
- Windows
- Linux
- Unix
- iOS
- Android

## Parts of an Operating System
The operating system is comprised of 4 main components
__These are:__
- The kernel
- The device drivers
- The user interface
- The system utilies

### Kernel
__The kernel is tasked with:__
- Loading and unloading applications from memory
- Memory management
- Scheduling tasks for the CPU
- File storage
- File management
- Data Security

In different operating systems, the kernel may be responsible for a slightly different blend of tasks but they are roughly the same

### Device Drivers
Device drivers tell the operating system how to interact with hardware
This allows it to control and communicate with the device
Any piece of hardware that would need to interact with the operating system will have a device driver for it
__Internal examples:__
- Hard disk
- DVD drive
- Graphics card

__External examples:__
 - Printer
 - Mouse
 - Keyboard
 
 Device drivers will often come bundled with the OS
 They are different for different operating systems
 ### User Interface
 The user interface allows the user to interact with the computer
 There are many different types of user interface
 |User Interface|Advantages|Disadvantages|
 |-|-|-|
 |Graphical User Interface|<li>Easy to use</li><li>Not necessary to memorise commands</li>|<li>Uses large amounts of memory</li>|
 |Command Line Interface|<li>Minimal memory usage</li><li>Fast for experienced users</li><li>Simple structure</li>|<li>Difficult to learn</li><li>Complex for novices</li>|
 |Menu|<li>Self-explanatory</li><li>Not necessary to memorise commands</li>|<li>Slower for experienced users</li><li>Limited menu options</li>|
 
 ### System Utilities
 The operating system comes with many system utilities that have a task to carry out
 This part of the operating system provides basic facilities that run in the background
 __Examples of system utilities include:__
- Print spool services
- File management services
- Anti-virus
- Disk defragmenter
- File compression
### Summary
- The operating system is core software that controls how a computer operates
- The four main sections of the OS are:
	- Kernel
	- Device drivers
	- Utilities
	- User interface
- The kernel handles the loading and unloading of software in main memory
- Device drivers allow the OS to communicate and control hardware
- System utilities perform background tasks such as file management
- A user interface allows a person to interact with the computer system
